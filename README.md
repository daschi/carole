### Carole the Tarot RAG

This project was started so that I could learn more about using the OpenAI API to generate responses, and to interpret my occasional tarot readings with Carole.

The app will:

- Accept user input (tarot cards drawn, their order, spread used, and question asked).
- Retrieve relevant information about the tarot cards from specific websites like Biddy Tarot.
- Use OpenAIâ€™s API to generate an interpretation based on the retrieved information.

### Tools

- Python: For backend processing, handling the logic, and API interactions.
- JavaScript: For building the frontend and providing user interaction.
- OpenAI API: To generate meaningful interpretations using GPT models.
- Web Scraping: To fetch information from tarot websites (e.g., Biddy Tarot).
